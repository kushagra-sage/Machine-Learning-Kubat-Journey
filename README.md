Machine Learning Journey - Kubat's "Introduction to Machine Learning"

"The ultimate test of whether a certain algorithm has been mastered is a running computer program: implementation will force you to think through all the details that might otherwise go unnoticed." - Miroslav Kubat

About This Repository

This repository documents my comprehensive, self-paced journey through Miroslav Kubat's "An Introduction to Machine Learning" (3rd Edition) - a 21-chapter expedition from fundamental concepts to cutting-edge techniques including Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning, and Neural Networks.

Why implement from scratch? Kubat designed his textbook around a simple but powerful principle: true mastery comes through building, not just using. Every algorithm will be implemented from mathematical foundations to develop genuine understanding.

Learning Philosophy

Kubat's Four Core Principles:
1. Simplicity - Clear explanations over excessive sophistication
2. Programmer's Perspective - Every algorithm implementable in general-purpose languages
3. Consistency - Uniform difficulty and mathematical abstraction levels
4. Practical Focus - Emphasis on what truly matters for understanding

Three-Tiered Learning Method:
Following Kubat's proven pedagogical approach:
1. Theory Deep Dive - Understand mathematical foundations and concepts
2. From-Scratch Implementation - Convert pseudocode to working Python programs
3. Exercises and Thought Experiments - Develop intuition and practical wisdom

Implementation Philosophy

No Shortcuts Approach:
- No sklearn, tensorflow, or pre-built ML libraries for core algorithms
- Pure Python implementations from mathematical first principles
- Pseudocode-to-code translation for deep algorithmic understanding
- Extensive documentation and comments explaining every step
- Testing on simple datasets before moving to complex applications
